I won't say i am 100% ready because i firmly believe i still have alot of self work to do to master this skill and become better.
My experience in the bootcamp was amazing, i had a patient and vaste instructor, my team mates were amazing.
Coding in general is alot of work but i am not stopping here. 
I will continue to practice to become better at this.
Thank you for having me in GoMyCode.
